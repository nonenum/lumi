# Lumi
### Basic GTK4 Desktop Pet

My first Linux specific program, made for personal use, and entertainment.

### Requirements

This program forces the legacy x11

You need to install **wmctrl** for your distribution in order to run Lumi

In Fedora's case use:

```bash
  sudo dnf install wmctrl
```
